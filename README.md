J1939-Addon
===================

###MAJOR UPDATE ###

THIS VERSION HAS MAJOR CHANGES.  THE TRANSPORT LAYER FOR DATA WAS MOVED FROM A CUSTOM IMPLEMENTATION TO NATIVE XNET SUPPORT.  THIS REQUIRES NI-XNET 16.0.

MANY FEATURES HAVE BEEN ADDED OR CHANGED.  IT WOULD BE BEST TO DELETE ANY PREVIOUS J1939 ADDON CONFIGURATION FROM YOUR SYSTEM DEFINITION, DELETE THE ADDON OUT OF YOUR CUSTOM DEVICES FOLDER, UPGRADE TO THIS VERSION, AND RE-BUILD YOUR SYSTEM DEFINITION.  

### Description ###

This addon implements the J1939-21 specification (namely the transport protocols). The user can import j1939 messages from a .DBC file and then read or write those messages. In addition, this addon supports requesting and clearing active and previously active diagnostic trouble code. It support address claiming for addon's configured address. A custom workspace object and tool are provided for viewing network topology and DTCs among other things.

### Help ###

Help is included in most System Explorer sections.
